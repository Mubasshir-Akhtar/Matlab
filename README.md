# MATLAB

This repository contains MATLAB and Simulink code that I've written.

It contains the simulations for 
1. [Four Bar Mechanism](https://github.com/Mubasshir-Akhtar/Matlab#four-bar-mechanism)
2. [Slider Crank Mechanism](https://github.com/Mubasshir-Akhtar/Matlab#slider-crank-mechanism)
3. [Velocity Calculation of Stars](https://github.com/Mubasshir-Akhtar/Matlab#velocity-calculation-of-stars)


# Four Bar Mechanism
[This folder](https://github.com/Mubasshir-Akhtar/Matlab/tree/main/Four%20Bar%20Mechanism) contains the MATLAB code for the position, velocity, and acceleration analysis of a four bar mechanism (RRRR chain). It only outputs position, velocity, and acceleration data for a four bar chain with given initial conditions. These initial conditions can be changed in the code.

# Slider Crank Mechanism
[This folder](https://github.com/Mubasshir-Akhtar/Matlab/tree/main/Slider%20crank%20mechanism) contains the SimuLink schematic/system for the simulation of a slider crank mechanism (RRRP chain). It produces graphs that show the variation of position, velocity, and acceleration of the slider with time. It also produces an animation of the system. 
Note: To see the animation as intended, change the plane of viewing to the xz plane.

# Velocity Calculation of Stars
[This folder](https://github.com/Mubasshir-Akhtar/Matlab/tree/main/Velocity%20Calculation%20of%20Stars) contains the MATLAB code for finding the velocity of a star that is moving relative to Earth using the spectral analysis method. The code here is inspired by the project in the [MATLAB Onramp course](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/details/matlab-onramp/gettingstarted) and the data is taken from the same. More details about the analysis and the data are in the MATLAB live script.

# More to come soon
I'll update this repo as I learn MATLAB and write more code.
