# Matlab

This repository contains MATLAB and Simulink code that I've written.

It contains the simulations for 
1. [Four Bar Mechanism](https://github.com/Mubasshir-Akhtar/Matlab#four-bar-mechanism)
2. [Slider Crank Mechanism](https://github.com/Mubasshir-Akhtar/Matlab#slider-crank-mechanism)


# Four Bar Mechanism
This folder contains the MATLAB code for the position, velocity, and acceleration of a four bar mechanism (RRRR chain). It only outputs position, velocity, and acceleration data for a four bar chain with given initial conditions. These initial conditions can be changed in the code.

# Slider Crank Mechanism
This folder contains the SimuLink schematic/system for the simulation of a slider crank mechanism (RRRP chain). It produces graphs that show the variation of position, velocity, and acceleration of the slider with time. It also produces an animation of the system. 
Note: To see the animation effectively, change the plane of viewing to the xz plane.

# More to come soon
I'll update this repo as I learn MATLAB and write more code.
