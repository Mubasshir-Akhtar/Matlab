# Matlab

This repository contains MATLAB and Simulink code that I've written.

It contains the simulations for 
1. [Four Bar Mechanism](https://github.com/Mubasshir-Akhtar/Matlab/tree/main/Four%20Bar%20Mechanism)
2. [Slider Crank Mechanism](https://github.com/Mubasshir-Akhtar/Matlab/tree/main/Slider%20crank%20mechanism)




I'll update this repo as I learn more MATLAB and write more code.
